# Analysis-of-Hacker-News-Posts

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News, a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon.
We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
